<h1>Whitespace Placement Report</h1>
<h3>By Calum Dixon</h3>

</div>

<div class="text-block">

<h2 id="introduction" class="anchor">Introduction</h2>

<p>For my third year on the IXD course, I started a placement year at the company Whitespace. Whitespace is innovation and venture studio that works closely with corporate and startups to accelerate them through from product ideation to product development and delivery.</p>

<p>My role has been as one of the UX Designers in the Whitespace Design Team. My role involved has involved the use of lots of skills from visual design and design strategy to occasional use of motion design and digital marketing.</p>

</div>

<div class="text-block">

<h2 id="about-company" class="anchor">About the company</h2>

<p>Whitespace started in 2014 as a venture capital fund that invested in startups that solved the problems for corporates. In 2017, the company started to transition into what it is today with the opening of the Belfast Innovation Lab; A product development studio with the aim to solve these problems for themselves cutting out the need for an investment fund that would be used on startups. Since the opening of the Innovation Lab, Whitespace has worked with a wide and varied client base including companies such as; BP, Cisco, Rolls-Royce, HM Government, TfL, Vodafone and more.</p>

<h2 id="company-role" class="anchor">My Role within Whitespace</h2>

<p>As of when I joined Whitespace as a designer I was joining a UX team of 3 others; Russell, Ed and Kelsey. The small size of the team made it much easier to get involved in all the different areas of the project lifecycle such as research, design, marketing and web development. This created a great opportunity to build upon and refine all the skills and knowledge I had coming in using real industry experience. </p>

<p>A second result of the small size of our design team is that we despite being a UX Team the onus for creating content and materials outside of what would be considered "User Experience Design"  often falls on us. Examples would be marketing imagery for Whitespace or the branding explorations we worked on for our contribution to the Emergent Alliance project (A coalition of companies from different business sectors working together to resolve issues related to COVID-19). While not specifically related to the role of UX I still valued these experiences since they didn't take up a large part of my role and allowed me to avoid letting my skills in these fields go stale.</p>

</div>

<p>My primary role while at Whitespace was assisting through the wireframing and UI process. While I was on placement there as a steady stream of new complicated projects coming in leading to me spending the majority of my time brainstorming component patterns, wireframing these patterns and eventually creating UI variations that could be handed off to our development team. Given the nature of some of our projects such as the one we are working on for HM Government, we were often working off of a limited set of knowledge which often resulted in our designs needing revised leading to the need of this role often taking centre stage. This is was an aspect of my placement that I grew to love since I found learning to brainstorm component patterns for products that were too complex to use standard patterns was incredibly rewarding across all projects and that the skill could be applied anywhere I went.</p>

</div>

<p>I have briefly mentioned it earlier but a major role I took up while working at Whitespace was the creation and management of all our Design Systems. This was probably the role I found most rewarding while working at Whitespace; through the role, I got to more closely work with the development team as well as more clearly understand how a systematic approach to product design can improve the product development journey. Until I took up this role within the company, the team was too small to commit the resources needed to manage a larger system so often small token components would be the only systemised components of a project. A secondary aspect I love about working on the design systems is that I think it's becoming an increasingly useful skill within the design industry as more companies adopt the same systemic approach how they design their products.</p>

<p>A secondary aspect I loved about my role at Whitespace was that during quieter periods where work was more sparse I was allowed the freedom to experiment with new skills that could be used down the road or expanded upon in specialities within the company. Thanks to opportunities such as this I've taken on new responsibilities such as creating and managing all our product design systems and prototyping any complex animations that can't be created in Figma within Protopie.</p>

<h4>Placement Competencies</h4>

<p>Coming into Whitespace there were a few competencies that were expected of me when I started such as being capable of delivering results on time. While at the very beginning I was allowed some leeway I would need to match the pace of the rest of the team to avoid blocking the project pipeline for others while they waited for me to delivery my designs, research, etc. The pipeline style of Whitespace has improved my time management skills since I've needed to be able to balance numerous different projects in a timely manner, while before much of work I've done in the past follows a more linear path.</p>

<p>As of when I joined Whitespace as a designer I was joining a UX team of 3 others; Russell, Ed and Kelsey. The small size of the team made it much easier to get involved in all the different areas of the project lifecycle such as research, design, marketing and web development. This created a great opportunity to build upon and refine all the skills and knowledge I had coming in using real industry experience. </p>

<h4>Learning and Skills</h4>

<p>Since Joining Whitespace I've learned an extensive list of new skills including learning new tools such as Figma, Protopie, Mailchimp, Sass, WordPress, Google Data Studio & Google Analytics, HotJar, Dovetail and Miro. These tools range from motion design tools (Protopie) that I use for advanced prototyping to Research tools that help facilitate workshops or gather user insights (HotJar, Dovetail, Miro, Google Analytics & Google Data Studio)</p>

<p>I think that my overall design skills have improved considerably since starting at Whitespace, not only in the aesthetic appearance of my designs but also in how I approach tackling an issue, I feel like I can much more easily decide on what should be used to solve a design problem in comparison to when I started. </p>

<p>I also think I've refined my other skills such as my teamwork skills a lot since joining as I've been forced into a position where I need to work well with others every day, which is a very different experience from a team project through the university.</p>

<h4>Response to Feedback</h4>

<p>Since I've been jumping between different projects often I got used to receiving feedback on lots of different teams. Despite this, I never really ran into any issues when receiving feedback since almost all examples I received came from internal projects and could be easily be resolved through slack if they weren't entirely clear. </p>

<p>What I appreciated most about my feedback from the Whitespace team was that it was all grounded in the reality of development. Often a particular choice may not be the best option because of how it implicates other teams or impacts the project pipeline. That said it was also important to decide with the design team wether a feature was worth pushing back against the development team and insisting that it be considered for the sake of the user experience.</p>

<h4>Challenges, Achievements and Disappointments</h4>

<p>My time at Whitespace was filled with a variety of challenging moments. The biggest challenge I faced was adjusting to the new style of working that involved lots of others since until placement my design process has been a largely solitary experience. Another big challenge was the change in the complexity of the products I worked on, most of the products worked on by Whitespace are data-driven (Such as Eamli a financial decision making support too) meaning there is a lot of back-end considerations that need to be accounted for.</p>

<p>Going into the placement year I didn't have any specific goals I wanted to accomplish beyond general improvement which I feel I accomplished to a degree that I'm happy with. Although one aspect I do feel proud of in retrospect is that I've become more confident in work, in uni I often felt I like I second-guessed myself, but having to consistently output high-quality work at Whitespace has accelerated my growth making me feel more firm in my approach.</p>

<p>I can't say I was disappointed with any part of my time at Whitespace, they've treated me fairly, taught me a so much and most importantly I've enjoyed working on the tasks they set me. </p>

<h4>Personal, Professional Development & Additional Qualifications</h4>

<p>Having the chance to dip my toes into every aspect of the design process as well as being allowed to explore new skills in during the design team's downtime has allowed me to gain lots of new skills and build specialities within the company. Combined with the general improvements I've made throughout the year, I feel as though I'm leaving placement being a stronger generalist whilst also holding unique skills that I can bring to the table to make myself a valuable asset to Whitespace or any other companies that might look to hire me in the future.</p>

<p>The area I've seen most development professionally would be the ability to work within the professional workstream, having had no experience with the inner workings of a studio like Whitespace before the start of my placement meant I had a lot of room for improvement within this area. Now reflecting on it at the end of my placement I can say I feel a lot more comfortable with professional workstreams. I understand every company is different though but I imagine that there will be crossover knowledge between studios.</p>

</div>

<p>Lastly, in terms of formal qualifications, I didn't gain much since many of the personal/professional development tasks I undertook were self-taught. That said I did earn qualifications in "Beginners Analytics, Advanced Analytics, Data Studio and Tag Manager" courses through the Google Analytics Academy.</p>

<h4>Communication and Independence</h4>

<p>Whitespace provided me with a perfect environment to build my teamwork and communication skills since I had the opportunity to work alongside both startup and corporate clients and a range of different internal teams including the marketing, development, of course, the design team.</p>

<h2 id="placement-impact" class="anchor">Impact of my Placement</h2>

<p>Placement has left a huge impression on me, it left me with plenty of valuable skills and has given me a new reality-based perspective on the design industry. It has also definitely help me reaffirm my decision to continue pursuing a role within the UX field of Design after university since I've enjoyed my time at Whitespace so much.</p>

</div>



<div class="text-block">

<h2 id="conclusion" class="anchor">Conclusion</h2>

<p>To summarise my placement I would say it was an invaluable experience and that I'd recommend anyone who has the chance to do a placement year to take it. I have met so many great people and learnt so much on my journey which all helped me explore different opportunities helping me decide what kind of designer I want to be in the future.</p>

<div class="text-block">

<h2 id="acknowledgements" class="anchor">Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>During my placement year at Whitespace, I've been helped by an entire team of talented individuals who have all provided me with the support I needed. The UX team specifically has helped me immensely, just being able to peer into the process has been able to take away so much but the team has also been incredibly helpful with giving me input where I needed it and sharing the insights they have to help me grow.</p>

<p>My experience working with the design team started working alongside our design lead Russell. Russell was an amazing mentor who always set aside time to help me through an issue when I needed it and his insights and input were critical in helping me grow over the course my of time at Whitespace.</p>

<p>Any time I had to work on a research task Kelsey was a fantastic mentor, she was able to provide an endless list of useful advice and examples from her time at Fathom, it made working on what I considered my weakest area of the design process at the beginning of my placement much easier.</p>

<p>When working on web dev related tasks Ed was more than helpful, he introduced me to new tools and techniques I had never used before and was always willing to give me a hand when there was a problem I was struggling to solve. Ed also worked with me on lots of design tasks, his input was always useful and overall made solving design problems much easier.</p>
